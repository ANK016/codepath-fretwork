        "1. Build and evaluate three models: Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Neural Network.\n",

The model helps solve the critical business problem of unpredictable cancellations by providing highly accurate, early risk flags.The main limitation is its \"black box\" nature, making specific risk factors harder to explain. Future improvements could be gained by incorporating real-time economic indicators (e.g., local events, competitor pricing) to enhance predictive accuracy.\n",
